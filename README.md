 **OptimusBahn** is a script which visualizes train delays and other informations for easy infrastructure problem detection.
</p>

This is my submission for the **DB Open Data Contest** â€“ unfortunately I only discovered this contest last friday therefore
I couldn't add all the features I initially planned.  

## Feature Overview

OptimusBahn collects train delay information on a mySQL database and shows insights on how many trains are delayed (per day, per hour, per month).

It's capable of tracking multiple trains and train stations in near realtime thanks to threading support.

It automatically exports snapshots from the database into a graphs in the webfrontend.

Optimus by default does not make any assumptions on why a certain train is delayed.


## Installation

**Note**: You need at least Python 3.6 for this project.

Clone the repository and install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then edit your `config.cfg` file and add the required mySQL connection credentials:

```ini
[app]
threads = 1

[mysql]
host = 127.0.0.1
user = root
passwd = root
db = optimus
```

Be sure that the mySQL database is created beforehand.

Now start optimus by running:
```bash
python optimusbahn.py
```

## Screenshots

Due to limited timing I can't show you a live version of this script as of now.
Therefore I'll add a few screenshots to satisfy the curiosity.

## Gotchas

Depending on how many threads you are using the database might crash if you're on MacOS and using MAMP because of default configuration
limitations.

Adjust to meet the specifications of your current machine/server.
